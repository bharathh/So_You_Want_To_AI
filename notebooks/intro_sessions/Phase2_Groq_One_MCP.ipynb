        "\n",
        "- **MCP server** — A service that exposes **tools** (actions the model can call, e.g. “search Hugging Face”), **resources** (read-only data, e.g. files or APIs), and optionally **prompts** (predefined prompt templates). The server runs somewhere (your machine, a cloud URL) and speaks the MCP protocol (JSON-RPC over stdio or HTTP/SSE).\n",
        "- **MCP client** — The application that has the model (e.g. Groq API, Cursor). It connects to one or more MCP servers, sends the user’s prompt, and when the model decides to use a tool, the client calls that tool on the server and returns the result to the model.\n",
        "- **Tool** — One capability the server provides (e.g. “search_models”, “read_file”). The model sees tool names and descriptions, chooses when to call them, and receives structured results.\n",
        "\n",
        "So: **you add an MCP server** (by URL or config) to your client; the **model then can use that server’s tools** during a conversation, without you hand-writing glue code for each integration."

        "1. **Expose** those actions as callable “tools” with clear names and parameters.\n",
        "2. **Run** the tool when the model asks and **return** the result as text (or structured data) back to the model.\n",
        "3. Do this in a **consistent way** across many apps and providers.\n",
