        "**Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** is a **subword** tokenization algorithm: text is split into pieces that can be smaller than a word (e.g. \"running\" → \"run\" + \"ning\"). That way we don't need a separate entry for every word—we learn a **fixed set of subword pieces** from data and can represent **any** string by concatenating them.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Start from characters (or bytes).** The text is first split into characters (or byte-level units).\n",
        "2. **Learn merges from a corpus.** We count how often every **pair** of adjacent units appears (e.g. \"t\" + \"h\" → \"th\"). We repeatedly **merge the most frequent pair** into a new single token and add it to the vocabulary. After many such merges we have a vocabulary of subwords (single chars, frequent chunks like \"th\", \"ing\", whole common words, etc.).\n",
        "3. **Encode new text.** To tokenize a new sentence we split it into characters, then apply the **same merge rules in order**. The result is a sequence of **token IDs** (one integer per subword).\n",
        "4. **Decode.** To go back to text we map each token ID to its subword string and concatenate.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why LLMs use BPE:** A fixed vocabulary of ~50k subwords can represent any sentence. Rare words become several tokens (e.g. \"tokenizer\" → \"token\" + \"izer\"); common words may stay one token. The model only ever sees **sequences of integers** (token IDs); we'll see next how each ID is then mapped to a **vector**."
