        "\n",
        "Workflows differ in **how agents are ordered** and **how they share information**. Three high-level categories:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Sequential workflows**\n",
        "\n",
        "Agents run **one after another** in a fixed order. Output of step *N* becomes input to step *N+1*.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flow:** `Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → …`\n",
        "- **Data:** Each step consumes the previous step’s output (and optionally the original user goal).\n",
        "- **Use when:** The task has a natural pipeline (e.g. research → evaluate → recommend), dependencies are clear, and you want predictable, auditable steps.\n",
        "- **Trade-offs:** Easy to reason about and debug; latency adds up (no parallelism). Best with a **single strong model** per step or **specialist models** (e.g. one for search, one for summarization).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:** Document ingestion (parse → extract → classify), model selection (research → evaluate → recommend), content pipelines (research → draft → review).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Parallel workflows**\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple agents (or branches) run **at the same time**, on the same or different inputs. Results are merged later.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flow:** Fork into *N* branches; each branch runs independently; then join (e.g. vote, rank, or concatenate).\n",
        "- **Data:** Same input broadcast to all branches, or different slices (e.g. by topic). Merge step combines outputs.\n",
        "- **Use when:** You need **diversity** (e.g. multiple draft answers to pick from), **coverage** (e.g. analyze 5 documents in parallel), or **redundancy** (e.g. multiple reviewers). Best when steps are **independent** and you can afford multiple model calls.\n",
        "- **Trade-offs:** Lower end-to-end latency than doing the same steps sequentially; higher cost per request. Merge logic (voting, ranking, summarization) must be designed carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:** Multi-perspective summarization (each agent summarizes one section in parallel, then merge), parallel code reviews (several agents review the same PR), A/B-style answer generation (generate 3 answers in parallel, then rank).\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Coordinated workflows**\n",
        "\n",
        "A **coordinator** (or router) decides **which agent(s)** to call, in **what order**, and possibly **multiple rounds**. Flow is dynamic, not fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Flow:** Coordinator receives goal → chooses next agent(s) and task(s) → agents run (possibly in parallel) → coordinator gets results → repeats or finishes.\n",
        "- **Data:** Coordinator maintains state (e.g. plan, partial results, history); agents receive sub-tasks and return structured or free-form results.\n",
        "- **Use when:** The task is **open-ended** or **multi-step with branching** (e.g. “answer this question using whatever tools you need”), or when you want **one agent to delegate** to specialists. Fits **planner–executor** and **tool-using single agent** patterns.\n",
        "- **Trade-offs:** Flexible and powerful; harder to debug and more variable in cost/latency. Often implemented with a **single model that has access to tools** (including “call another agent” as a tool) or a **dedicated coordinator model** that outputs a plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Examples:** Research assistant (plan → search → read → synthesize → maybe search again), helpdesk (classify → route to specialist agent → maybe escalate), iterative refinement (draft → critique → revise until satisfied).\n",
